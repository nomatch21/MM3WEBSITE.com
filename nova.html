				<sub>MAY 22, 2021</sub><br>
				<p class="nov">Being Bsba student It's a biggest journey in my life to choose my path in my college years, it focuses my career that has many challenges comes to my life and more gaining knowledge that I have learned in class
				I am marketing student but apart from that reason why Im taking up marketing. I soon became to realize how important it is and Im going to love it because its all about focusing to the customers wants and what they needs and through that we are able to hear what else to create what else to make or innovate and I see this as a way to change and better. Honestly, the life of student is not easy but is the most important for me  to learn skills, acquire good knowledge and have a GOOD ATTITUDE.</p>
