				<p class="kim">My name is Elan Kim A. Dumogho, 21 years old, a student from Holy Cross of Davao College. Let me tell you things about myself; I am currently studying for Bachelor of Science in Business Administration Major in Marketing Management. I am also one of the committee members of the Crossians’ Marketing Management Club and a member of BSBA Talents. These organizations taught me a lot of things and have helped me to discover more of my talents and capabilities.</p>

					My 3 years as student in Holy Cross of Davao College had played a huge part in discovering oneself that had drawn me in terms of exploring my potentials, skills, talents and abilities. Being a BSBA student was challenging yet exciting as choosing marketing management as my major course wasn’t all about enjoyment, it was also about the many ups and downs, accomplishments, and failures, yet nevertheless, the great experiences, memories, and lessons learned was what I treasure the most.

				<p>	The BSBA Concert was the best memorable experience that happened in my life. I was able to perform in one of the best events in Holy Cross of Davao College wherein lots of us were able to expose our talents and show our best to pull off the event successfully. It was also a good day being free from stress and paper works and I have cherished every single moment of it. It was amazing and fun as it brings back the 80’s & 90’s vibes and I’m very thankful to all the people who made the event possible.

					These experiences of mine had made me become resilient, cooperative, and imaginative. I’ve learned a lot of things especially in learning about the concept of business organizations which is in line to the course that I’m taking. I do admit that not all subjects were easy and there I had some hard times when studying, but I always kept in mind that it’s from our hard work and sacrifices and about how you keep yourself interested in it, being equipped and self-assertive.

						Though in today’s situation we have a pandemic, it did give lots of adjustments when it comes to studies and activities most especially in coping up with the new online modality and understanding the new virtual medium, but, this crisis will not be a hindrance to stop from learning, focusing, and enjoying our studies.

						With the help of the educators, we were molded to become a skillful and responsible person. It may be hard and difficult to overcome these challenges in our studies but Holy Cross of Davao College never fails to bring a smile on our faces and enjoy our college life. It’s still more fun in HOLY CROSS OF DAVAO COLLEGE!
