				<h5>Anne Margarette Gamil</h5>
				<sub>MAY 22, 2021</sub><br>
				<p class="anne">I am Anne Margarette Gamil, a 22-year-old and currently a third-year student at Holy Cross of Davao College, taking up a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration major in Marketing Management. It is a great privilege to study here in Davao City since I am from Davao de Oro. I am a probinsyana who is determined to pursue my dreams here in the City.

					Since I was a kid, I have always dreamed of studying here in Davao. With the help and support of my dearest family, here I am today, making my dreams come true. I discovered many things and experienced different struggles in life. Sometimes I do experience failure, but when I fail, I double my effort and give my whole best to be better. In every achievement, I always owe it to God.

				<p>As years go by, I meet different people and learn from them. I discovered many stories about their life, struggles, problems, families, stand in life, and how they dealt with it. Sometimes, it made me realize that even though we do not have everything, we need to be grateful for what we have and be thankful. Reaching out to others and helping them in our own little ways will make them happy. Giving is not about the quantity that counts, but our sincerity and desire to help are what counts the most.

					Things become more interesting when discovering new things that give us new knowledgeâ€”executing it as how it is or how it is performed during the actual work. Knowing those things makes us more prepared for the future and understand and experience how it goes, and know the things that need to be considered and determined. As marketing students, we also challenge ourselves to understand customer behavior and their way of choosing the product. Acquiring those knowledge makes us more observant and appreciative of how marketing works in the business industry.

					<p class="text">College journey wouldn't be complete without knowing new people, meeting new people, and having my closest friends. From a stranger, we become friends. Our friendship becomes a strong bond. We treat not just as friends, but we treat each other as family. We laugh, we cry, we talk about our future, and we are happy to share our success with each one of us. We are driven to work harder to reach our dreams.
